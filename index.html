	<h1>Living in the Best Cities</h1></div><br>
	<h2> <p1>8.</p1> Wellington,New Zealand</h2>
	<div class="container"><img src="https://publicspace.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/new-zealand-3719-2-1140x500.jpg" width="900" height="350"></div>
			<p>The capital and second most populous city of <strong>New Zealand</strong> makes our top 10 in large part due to the high scores bestowed by Deutsche Bank, which rewarded Wellington with the second spot in its survey after two consecutive years on the top. Commutes are short, pollutions levels are low and purchasing power ratios—researchers say—are among the best in the world. While the bank’s ranking does not focus on cultural and entertainment opportunities and only features cities relevant to global financial markets, it does not hurt the fact that Wellington—a tight-knit and diverse community of about half a million people—can boast stunning beaches and bays, a vibrant cultural life and restaurants and cafés at almost every corner.</p>
	<h2> <p1>7.</p1> Toronto,Canada</h2>

		<p><strong>Toronto</strong> is one of three Canadian cities in this year's top ten, earning perfect marks for stability, healthcare, and education. We particularly applaud Toronto for being one of the most welcoming cities in the world. More than 46 percent of the nearly three million-strong population is foreign-born, and their reception game is so strong that they refer to immigrants as "newcomers".</p>
	<h2> <p1>6.</p1> Tokyo,Japan</h2>
	<div class="container"><img src="https://16jp781s7hqv3vm1s322uful-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/daytime-neon-shibuya-crossing-tokyo-japan.jpg"  width="900" height="350"></div>
		<p>When it comes to the quality of urban living, smallness is often an asset; <strong>Tokyo</strong> is an exception. Recent estimates put the number of Tokyo residents at almost 14 million, a figure that grows to over 38 million when we consider the greater metropolitan area, making the city home to one-quarter of the entire Japanese population and the world's largest urban agglomeration economy. As tourists prepare to visit for the 2020 Olympic Games, this supercity occupies the second spot in the Monocle’s survey and the eighth spot in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s ranking due to its cultural and social life and the quality of its services and institutions.</p>
	<h2><p1>5.</p1> Vancouver,Canada</h2>
	<div class="container"><img src="https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/AG9rqbKr_2aqtBVFB4lKlpFnO1o=/3865x2174/smart/filters:no_upscale()/false-creek-in-vancouver-520447354-5ad8a8778023b900360aae96.jpg"  width="900" height="350"></div>
		<p>Coming in fifth place in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s liveability index and the third in Mercer’s list,<strong>Vancouver</strong> is an ideal place to live, visit and work. In evaluating living conditions in more than 450 locations worldwide based on indicators in 10 categories, Mercer’s experts note that this city coastal city of about 630,000 people is the perfect destination for multinational corporations and their employees. But not only that. In<em> Vancouver</em>, there is something for everyone: a thriving art scene, great food and the most stunning natural attractions.</p> 
		<p>Vancouver is no stranger to the Global Liveability Report: It earned the number one spot from 2002 to 2010, and again in 2015. Despite dropping in the ranks in recent years, Canada’s third largest city has undeniable appeal. Travelers and expats alike are drawn to Vancouver for its parks, museums, shopping and, perhaps most notably, a rich and varied culinary and cocktail scene that has become even more impressive after the city’s star turn hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics.</p>
	<h2><p1>4.</p1> Melbourne,Australia</h2>
	<div class="container"><img src="https://www.visitvictoria.com/-/media/images/melbourne/destinations/melbourne-park_mel_r_supplied-082_1150x863.jpg?ts=20170206470129"  width="900" height="350"></div>
		<p>Australia’s second-largest city after Sydney takes the seventh spot in the Deutsche Bank’s survey and comes in second in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s list after eight consecutive years on the top. <strong>Melbourne</strong> excels in all areas, be it healthcare and education, infrastructure, or culture and environment. A renown financial and commercial center, its population of about 5 million can also enjoy beautiful architecture and parks, delicious food and breathtaking views of the ocean. The rivalry between Melbourne and Sydney is legendary, but for those who have to pick between the two there is no wrong choice to be made.</p>
	<h2> <p1>3.</p1> Munich,Germany</h2>
	<div class="container"><img src="https://images-global.nhst.tech/image/Vkp3RDBpZXJaQXA5SFdiazh6MGc0dTJsWUYzditDOERQY0Uwd3BsRlAyST0=/nhst/binary/3750a40a300d5d73de18e9c092dcad96"  width="900" height="350"></div>
		<p>Coming in third place in Monocle’s survey and fourth in Mercer’s ranking, <strong>Munich</strong> combines effective public services with a healthy work-life balance. A highly international city with affordable universities attracting students from all over the world and an airport offering connections to almost 300 destinations, Munich is also close to the Alps and famous for its storybook-like countryside. With a population of around 1.5 million, owing to the high concentration of industries, providers of financial services and other businesses, the Bavarian capital boasts an unemployment rate of just 3.5%, among of the lowest in the EU.</p>
	<h2> <p1>2.</p1> Zurich,Switzerland</h2>
	<div class="container"><img src="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/travel/Guide-Pages/europe/city-aerial-zurich-switzerland.adapt.1900.1.jpg"  width="900" height="350"></div>
	 	<p>First in the Monocle’s and Deutsche Bank’s rankings and second on the Economist Intelligence Unit’s list,<strong> Zurich</strong> knows how to mix business with pleasure. An increasingly diverse and inclusive location, today the city—with its over 400,000 residents—is a unique combination of different cultures, religions and languages. On one hand, it attracts tech startups and established multinational corporations, on the other is full of attractions, galleries, boutiques and clubs. Certainly, the cost of living is sky-high: a fast-food hamburger can cost 15 Swiss francs (about $15 U.S. dollars), and renting a two-bedroom apartment will set you back by over 4,000. But if you are lucky enough to be gainfully employed in this almost too perfect city surrounded by majestic mountains, green pastures and scenic rivers, you can probably afford to splurge: the median monthly salary is about 7,000 francs.</p>
	<h2> <p1>1.</p1> Vienna, Austria</h2>
	<div class="container"><img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2019%2F06%2Fvienna-city-austria-VIENNA0619.jpg&q=85"  width="900" height="350"></div>
		<p>Maintaining its position in the number one spot for the second year in a row,<strong> Vienna</strong> provides the perfect blend of adventure, affordability, ease of living, and safety. The Austrian capital draws crowds with its Baroque architecture and Danube cruises, but it's just as exciting as a center of what’s new in the culinary and art worlds of Europe. And due to a city government that puts a lot of resources behind infrastructure and housing, the cost of living here is far lower than comparable European cities.</p>
